# MockFlow - The Ultimate Frontend Mocking Companion

**MockFlow** is a modern, lightweight, and AI-powered fake API generator designed for frontend developers who don't want to wait for the backend. It's built on top of the principles of **Mockoon** but streamlined for immediate, in-browser use.

## 🚀 Key Features for the Judges (1-Min Demo Plan)

1.  **Instant Setup (0:10s)**: "As a frontend developer, I don't want to wait for backend teams. With MockFlow, I can define my entire API schema in seconds."
2.  **Magic Fill (0:20s)**: "Don't have data? Use our AI-inspired Magic Fill to generate realistic mock responses instantly." (Click the Zap icon in the editor).
3.  **Real-time Simulation (0:40s)**: "Hit 'Test API' to simulate a real server call. We even handle network latency, giving you a true-to-life integration experience directly in your browser."
4.  **Human-Centric Design**: Every action includes a **Guide Chat** that translates technical API data into plain English scenarios, making it accessible for non-technical stakeholders like PMs or Designers.
5.  **Ecosystem Compatibility (1:00s)**: "When the project grows, MockFlow grows with you. Export your configuration with one click and import it directly into **Mockoon** for advanced desktop features."
