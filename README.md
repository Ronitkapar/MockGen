# ⚡ MockFlow AI - The Digital "Stunt Double" for Your Website

### 🌟 What is MockFlow?
Imagine you are building a beautiful restaurant (a website). Usually, you have to wait for the Chef (the Backend Developer) to finish cooking the food (the API) before you can layout the tables.

**MockFlow** is your "Stunt Double." It uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to create realistic "fake food" instantly. This means you can design your entire website and see exactly how it will look and behave, without waiting for the real data to be ready.
